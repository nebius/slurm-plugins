# Slurm Plugins

This repository contains a collection of custom plugins for [Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/). These plugins extend Slurm functionality to better support integration with specific environments, workloads, and infrastructure requirements.

## Overview

The plugins in this repository are designed to be modular and composable, enabling you to:

- Extend Slurm behavior via official plugin interfaces
- Integrate with custom resource managers, monitoring tools, or container runtimes
- Adapt Slurm to non-standard deployment environments (e.g., cloud-native or HPC-as-a-service setups)
